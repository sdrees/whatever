# [fit] To Mock or Not?

### [fit] Curse and Blessing of Test Doubles

![](lalala_IMG_1719.jpg)

# [fit] Taxonomy (Gerard Meszaros, Martin Fowler)

* **Dummy** objects are passed around but never actually used. 
* **Fake** objects actually have working (simplified) implementations.
* **Stubs** provide canned answers to calls made during the test, usually not responding at all to anything outside what's programmed in for the test.
* **Spies** are stubs that also record some information based on call. 
* **Mocks** are objects pre-programmed with expectations which form a specification of the calls they are expected to receive.

# [fit] Mock User Code 1 (Python stdlib unit.mock)

```python 
>>> from unittest.mock import MagicMock
>>> thing = ProductionClass()
>>> thing.method = MagicMock(return_value=3)
>>> thing.method(3, 4, 5, key='value')
3
>>> thing.method.assert_called_with(3, 4, 5, key='value')
```

But beware of **private** implementation details ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ !

---

# [fit] Mock User Code 2 (Test)

Calling `ProductionClass().method` triggers `something` method:

```python 
>>> class ProductionClass:
...     def method(self):
...         self.something(1, 2, 3)
...     def something(self, a, b, c):
...         pass
...
>>> real = ProductionClass()
>>> real.something = MagicMock()
>>> real.method()
>>> real.something.assert_called_once()
```

---

# [fit] Mock User Code 3 (Context Manager)

```python 
>>> from unittest.mock import patch
>>> with patch.object(ProductionClass, 'method', return_value=None) as mock_method:
...     thing = ProductionClass()
...     thing.method(1, 2, 3)
...
>>> mock_method.assert_called_once_with(1, 2, 3)
```
Language capabilities of :snake: offer easy patching - also via decorators!

# [fit] Anything goes . . . :cloud:7

---

# [fit] Mock User Code 3 (Patch Dict)

# [fit] `patch()` (temporarily) changes the object a name points to with another one

```python 
>>> foo = {'key': 'value'}
>>> original = foo.copy()
>>> with patch.dict(foo, {'newkey': 'newvalue'}, clear=True):
...     assert foo == {'newkey': 'newvalue'}
...
>>> assert foo == original
```

---

# [fit] Mock System Code (Python stdlib unit.mock)

```python 
>>> m = mock_open()
>>> with patch('__main__.open', m):
...     with open('foo', 'w') as h:
...         h.write('some stuff')
...
>>> m.mock_calls
[call('foo', 'w'),
 call().__enter__(),
 call().write('some stuff'),
 call().__exit__(None, None, None)]
>>> m.assert_called_once_with('foo', 'w')
>>> handle = m()
>>> handle.write.assert_called_once_with('some stuff')
```

# [fit] C++ Production Class - Kind of ... (Google Mock)

Easy way to go virtual and hook into the vtable (:older_man:'s guess):

```c++
class ProductionInterface {
  ...
  virtual ~ProductionInterface() {}
  virtual void Method() = 0;
  virtual void Progress(int distance) = 0;
  virtual void GoTo(int x, int y) = 0;
  virtual int GetX() const = 0;
};
```
> mocking non-virtual methods using templates is much more involved

# [fit] C++ Mock Class

```c++
#include "gmock/gmock.h"  // Brings in Google Mock.
class MockProductionInterface : public ProductionInterface {
 public:
  ...
  MOCK_METHOD0(Method, void());
  MOCK_METHOD1(Progress, void(int distance));
  MOCK_METHOD2(GoTo, void(int x, int y));
  MOCK_CONST_METHOD0(GetX, int());
};
```

# [fit] C++ Test With Mock

```c++
#include "path/to/mock-productioninterface.h"
#include "gmock/gmock.h"
#include "gtest/gtest.h"
using ::testing::AtLeast;
TEST(MethodTest, CanUseSpecialMethod) {
  MockProductionInterface blueprint;
  EXPECT_CALL(blueprint, Method()).Times(AtLeast(1));
  ProductionClass thing(&blueprint); 
  EXPECT_TRUE(thing.SpecialMethod(0, 0, 10));
}
int main(int argc, char** argv) {
  ::testing::InitGoogleMock(&argc, argv);
  return RUN_ALL_TESTS();
}
```

# Mock Guidelines

* Use with care - always :bomb:
* Low-level ease of use depends on language capablities :snake:
* Do not test private implementation details (order of arguments, ...)
* High-level: Anything goes :smile: but:
  * Closely monitor benefit / cost ratio
  * Shape expectations
